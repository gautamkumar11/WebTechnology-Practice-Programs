        <h1> DOM in javascript</h1>
        <h1> Notes:</h1>
        <pre style="font-size: 25px; background-color: antiquewhite;">
           * DOM stands for document object model.
           * The dom is a cross- platform and language-independent.
           * interface that treat as HTML, document as a tree structure. 
           * where each element is an object representing a part of the document.

            Example: 
        
            <img src="code_images/DOMJS1.png" width="50%" height="300px;">
            
                                Document 
                                  HTML
                 Head                            body
                Title                         h1 div id       div id
                my page                       headings, p         p  


           * All the particular tags will be known as elementt tag/ element node
           * Title -> My page -> (My page is going to known as text node)
           * ID -> (ID will be consider as attribute node)
           * class -> (class will beconsider as attribute node)


           Methods of DOM elements:
           1) Query selector
           2) Query selector All
           3) Document.getElementById 
           4) Text content 
           5) Document.getElementByClass 
           6) Document.getElemntbytagname


           ctreateElement: If we want to create any element dynamically means 
                        without "document.createElement". 
                        Now element will be created. 

           New element will be created. 
           * Query selector:
             If we have multiple class or id property or same tags 
             it will indicate only the first class or first id, or 
             first tag property as output.

             Query selectorAll:
             -- with the help of query selector all we can the properties at a time. 
             If you try to pass some css property for all the elements 
             we have to call for loop inside the queryselector all.
             
             Document.getElementbyClass







             Text content: if we want to make changes any data in dynamic 
             way it means without changing it from html. 
             If we will call textContent inside the script tag we are able 
             to make changes the data as a dynamic way.


            DIFERRENCE BETWEEN textContent AND innerHTML:- 
             1) innerHTMK will use to call any tag from html to script. 
             2) based on this particular tag the data will change and it 
                will give us the output. 
             3) text content is used to only change the data as a dynamic way. 
             4) If we try to call any html tags inside textcontent it will 
             return the tag AS output.

            Regular Expression: 
            - A regular expression is an object that describe a pattern of characters.
            - The js is regular expression class represents regilar expression 
                and both string and regExp define methods that use regular 
                expression to perform powerfulpattern matching and search and 
                replace function on text.
            
            Syntax:
             - A regular expression could be defined with the regExp() constructor.
             var pattern = new regExp(pattern, attributes);
             or 
             var pattern = /pattern/attributes;

             Pattern: 
             - A string that specifics the pattern of the regular expression.
            
             Attributes: 
             - An optional string containing any of the "g", "i" and "m" attributes. 
             - Those attributes specify global, case-insesitive and multi line 
             matches respectively. 
             Patterns of js: 
             1) [A-Z] 
             2) [a-z] 
             3) [0-9] 
             4) [A-z a-z] 
             5) [A-z 0-9] 
             6) [a-z 0-9] 
             7) [A-z a-z 0-9]

             Quartifires: 
             1) ^ -Work as starting with 
             2) $ -Work as ending with
             3) + -It matches any string containing one or more.
             4) * -It matches any string containing zero or more.
       
            Methods in regular expression: 
            1) test() -the regular expression test() method is used to 
                test for match in a string. If there is a match this method 
                returns true else it return false. 

            2) trim() - The trim() method removes whitespaces from both 
                    side of string. But the trim() method does not change the original string. 
            
            3) value() -It is used matching the pattern data.
